# Tanish's Full-Stack Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal full-stack portfolio website! This project serves as a dynamic showcase of my technical skills, educational background, professional experience, and personal projects. It's built with a modern tech stack, designed to be responsive, and features an interactive terminal-like interface.

## Project Description

This portfolio website provides a comprehensive overview of my profile. Key features include:

-   **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
-   **Interactive Terminal Interface:** A unique element that provides an engaging way to navigate and interact with certain sections.
-   **Detailed Sections:** Dedicated areas for my experience, education, skills, and projects.
-   **Contact Form:** A way for visitors to get in touch directly.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages a robust full-stack architecture using the following technologies:

### Frontend

-   **React:** A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's used here to create the dynamic and interactive components of the portfolio.
-   **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static type checking. This enhances code maintainability, reduces errors, and improves developer productivity.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid and flexible styling directly in the HTML markup. It's used to create the modern and responsive design of the portfolio.

### Backend

-   **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment that allows for server-side execution of JavaScript. It powers the backend of this application.
-   **Express:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It's used to build the RESTful API that handles contact form submissions and potentially other future backend functionalities.

### Deployment

-   **Render:** The platform used to deploy the full-stack application, making it accessible online.
